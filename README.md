# XamarinNRGScoutingApp
A cross-platform scouting app for FRC teams to use (currently developing for the 2017-18 Season for iOS and Android)
## Instructions:
For people who want to help develop this, get Xamarin Studio/Visual Studio from here: https://www.visualstudio.com/xamarin/ Keep in mind that you should be developing the "NRGScoutingApp" folder so that we can acheive the same features across platforms. If you don't have a Mac, you won't be able to see the iOS preview, but don't worry. If you're developing in the correct folder, it should automatically be compatible with both platforms.
