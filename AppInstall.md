# Installing the NRG Scouting App on your iOS or Android device (beta and non-app store builds

## Head to [releases](https://github.com/NRG948/XamarinNRGScoutingApp/releases) for the latest beta or official build. Beta builds are marked by two decimal points in the version number

## Android
Click on the .apk file and download it. Then open it. If should ask you about "Unknown Sources." Follow the instructions in the prompt and enable this because GitHub releases are not from the Google App Store

## iOS
Requires a Windows or Mac Computer...
Head to www.cydiaimpactor.com and download the version for your computer. 
Open the application and drag the .ipa file that you have downloaded from the releases page (linked above)
It will prompt for your apple ID and the corresponding password. Don't worry, this is safe as it is sent to apple servers directly to sign the app for your device.
After the App shows up on your phone, you cannot immediately open it. Go to Settings>General>Profiles and click on your email and allow and trust the profile.
GREAT, now you can launch the app. Keep in mind that your "profile" will expire every 7 days, so you must reinstall, though you should not lose any data
